Magic Box ðŸŽ¶: The Open-Source Multimedia Player

Magic Box is a versatile, custom-built media player for desktop environments, blending a classic interface with powerful, modern features. Developed in Python with PyQt5, it supports a wide range of audio and video formats.

Key Features:

    Dynamic Visualizer: Features a real-time, custom FFT audio spectrum visualizer that monitors system loopback audio, providing vibrant, data-driven feedback (requires manual loopback setup like Stereo Mix/PulseAudio).
    IPTV/Streaming Ready: Easily load and manage M3U/M3U8 playlists for streaming live TV channels or individual online media streams.
    Compact Mini Mode: Switch to a Mini Player for a seamless, space-saving playback experience while you multitask.
    Metadata Integration: Automatically fetches and displays song/video metadata (Title, Artist, Album, Copyright) and includes quick tools to search for media on external platforms like YouTube.
